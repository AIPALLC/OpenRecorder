# Is it open-sourced?
Yes, OpenRecorder is currently open-source. Unfortunately, the source code is too big so we weren't able to upload it here, so, you can download it [here](https://github.com/Pronner/OpenRecorder/tree/main/sourcecode/src_ORS).

# Why OpenRecorder?

**OpenRecorder** is a little different from other screen recording programs, it offers the best features it can to its users, with unlimited customizability. Unlike other recorders, we also offer built-in apps that make it easy to communicate with your viewers. Apps we currently provide: OpenNote, OpenPaint, OpenBrowser. In the future, we plan on creating more built-in apps like a Video editor/Thumbnail creator, etc...
