# Is it open-sourced?
Unfortunately, OpenRecorder is not open-sourced yet. Why?
Mainly because we haven't copyrighted the software/source yet and we will not be releasing the source until it gets copyrighted

# Why OpenRecorder?

**OpenRecorder** is a little different from other screen recording programmes, except that it offers the best features it can offer its users, and unlimited customizability. Unlike other recorders, we also offer built-in apps that make it easy to communicate with your viewers. Apps we currently provide: OpenNote, OpenPaint, OpenBrowser. In the future, we plan on creating more built-in apps like a Video editor/Thumbnail creator, etc...
